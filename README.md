Converted the JavaScript functions and variables to Pythonic syntax, including changing const declarations to variable assignments.
Used the requests library for sending HTTP POST requests.
Replaced the JavaScript Promise-based delay function with Python's time.sleep for pausing execution.
Adjusted the string template in the body variable to use Python's f-string format.
Implemented the asynchronous behavior through a simple loop with a delay, as Python's async/await pattern is not directly used here.
Wrapped the date processing logic in a if __name__ == "__main__": block to ensure it only runs when the script is executed directly.
